# Raspberry Pi Pico tutorials

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my tutorial series on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.

VS Code assumes that you have set these environment variables:
- **PICO_SDK_PATH** - points to the [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) directory
- the path to the ARM GNU Toolchain is included in the **PATH** variable

All projects include some basic configuration for VSCode, cmake and ARM GNU Toolchain. [This video](https://youtu.be/Sgv2NdKDLKg) shows a step-by-step instruction to configure all the required tools on Windows.

### The repository contents:

- "**templates**" contains simple "Hello World" examples to start your new projects for Raspberry Pi Pico from. One of them is a [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) sample application.
- "**tutorials**" contains all the source code used in my videos on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**. Each directory inside it is named after the video the source code is used in.
