## Raspberry Pi Pico templates

This directory contains the projects used in my tutorial series on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.
They all are meant to be a quick starting point for creating your own new projects.

### The contents:

- **HelloWorld** - a classic "Blinky". The most basic "Hello World" programme for Pico.
- **HelloWorld-FreeRTOS** - FreeRTOS version of "Blinky". Integrates FreeRTOS and creates a task to blink the default LED on the Pico board. It's a good starting point for any FreeRTOS applications. Includes the OS configuration tuned for the Pico.
